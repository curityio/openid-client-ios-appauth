Demonstrates how to implement an OpenID Connect mobile client using AppAuth libraries.

## Tutorial Documentation

The [Tutorial Walkthrough](https://curity.io/resources/learn/swift-ios-appauth) explains the complete configuration and behavior.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to run the code example is via an automated script as explained in the [Mobile Setup Article](https://curity.io/resources/learn/mobile-setup-ngrok):

- Copy a license.json file into the code example root folder
- Edit the `./start-idsvr.sh` script to use either a local Docker URL on an ngrok internet URL
- Run the script to deploy a preconfigured Curity Identity Server via Docker
- Build and run the mobile app from Xcode
- Sign in with the preconfigured user account `demouser / Password1`
- Run `./stop-idsvr.sh` when you want to free Docker resources

## User Experience

The example mobile app demonstrates OAuth lifecycle events, starting with an `Unauthenticated View`:

Once authenticated the `Authenticated View` show how to work with tokens and sign out:

The example app also demonstrates reliable handling of AppAuth errors.

## Security

AppAuth classes are used to perform the following security related operations accordng to [RFC8252](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252):

* Logins and Logouts via a secure ASWebAuthenticationSession window
* Use of Authorization Code Flow (PKCE)
